# [Ames, Iowa Housing Analysis](https://stephenhockey.github.io/projects/2017-11-14-ames-housing/)

Utilizing the exceptionally detailed and robust Ames Housing Dataset from Kaggle, I tried to predict two things:
* The price of a house at sale
* Whether a house sale was abnormal or not

# [Predicting Reddit Posts](https://stephenhockey.github.io/projects/2017-11-28-subreddits/)

Using a dataset that contains all of the posts made to a specific set of programming-oriented subreddits in the month of December. I made use of many different Natural Language Processing techniques in order to attempt to accurately predict the subreddit of each post.

# [Amazon Review Analysis](https://stephenhockey.github.io/projects/2017-12-20-amazon-ratings/)

With a very large dataset of ~1.6 million Amazon reviews on technological products, I again use Natural Language Processing to see how accurately I can predict a five-star rating. The main goal from this was to be able to pull out words that are strong predictors of a five-star rating or a non-five-star rating, that would also be useful to guide production of tech products.
