###### I am Stephen Hockey, a data scientist living in Toronto, who has recently finished the three month Data Science Immersive bootcamp at General Assembly in NYC. Before that I had always loved working with numbers, and later data after working extensively with Excel while at internships with TD Canada Trust. 

###### This actually wound up being my foray into (very basic) programming, when I taught myself Visual Basic to update all of a team's reporting workbooks at the press of a button. This was able to be used for both the weekly and monthly reporting, saving tens of hours a month even after I was gone, and getting me very interested in programming!

<!-- Finding out about how popular Python had become for working with data, together with it supposedly being a very beginner-friendly language, made learning it next just make sense.  -->

###### I got a pretty good grasp of the basics of the language using *Learn Python the Hard Way*, which I used as a foundation of knowledge going into the General Assembly Data Science Immersive course. Learning about this course seemed like a dream come true for me, as at the time I was lacking a sense of direction but had always enjoyed using numbers to solve problems and working with computers, and programming had been an additional recent interest.

###### For those three months we had a crash course in machine learning and statistical analysis using many of Pythons very popular libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit learn, statsmodels, etc.), while putting them to use on several different assigned projects. A few of those can be found here, as well as any projects I do on my own using ideas that come to me and publically available datasets!

###### So far I'm loving doing this kind of exploration into data, and learning new things every day about this quickly evolving field. If you would like to share any data science tips or links with me, or to contact me for any reason, I can be reached at stephenk.hockey@gmail.com.
